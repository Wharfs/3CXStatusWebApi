# 3CXStatusWebApi

This is designed to provide minimal select functionality to 3CX Phone system via a http interface.


* "Night Mode" aka "Out of Hours" status
* Extension profile status
* Set single extension profile
* Set all extensions profile

This is based off work by https://github.com/Montesuma80/3cx-web-API and some examples here https://github.com/fzany/3CXCallControlAPI_v16.

Utilises FastEndpoints for the API layer.
